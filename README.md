Overview of the Project
The project involves controlling a basic electronic component, an LED, using the Arduino platform. The objective of this task is to learn and understand how microcontrollers, specifically Arduino, can be used to perform simple control operations like blinking an LED. The project serves as a foundational step towards more advanced embedded systems applications.

Project: Blinking of LED Using Arduino IDE
This project utilizes the Arduino IDE and a basic Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno) to blink an LED. The LED is connected to a specific pin on the Arduino board, and through the IDE, a program (sketch) is written to control the ON and OFF states of the LED with specified intervals, effectively causing the LED to blink.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:

Understand the basic concepts of embedded systems, particularly in controlling external components using microcontrollers.
Learn to write a simple program (sketch) in the Arduino IDE to control the state of an LED.
Gain practical experience in working with the Arduino platform, hardware connections, and basic programming in embedded systems.
Key Activities
Setup Arduino IDE:
Installed and configured the Arduino IDE on the system and set up the Arduino mega board for the project.

LED Circuit Design:
Designed the circuit by connecting an LED to the designated digital I/O pin on the Arduino board, along with a suitable resistor (typically 220Ω) to limit the current and prevent damage to the LED.

Writing the Arduino Sketch:
Wrote the Arduino code (sketch) using the following logic:

Set the designated pin mode to output.
Turn the LED ON and OFF at regular intervals (e.g., 1 second).
Use digitalWrite() to control the LED's state and delay() to control the timing between the ON/OFF states.
Uploading Code to the Arduino:
Uploaded the written sketch to the Arduino board and tested the blinking behavior of the LED.

Troubleshooting:
Ensured proper wiring and checked the code for errors if the LED did not blink as expected.

Testing and Debugging:
Ran multiple tests to confirm that the LED blinked at the correct intervals, making adjustments to timing as necessary.

Technologies Used
Arduino IDE: For writing and uploading the code to the Arduino board.
Arduino Uno: A microcontroller board used for controlling the LED.
LED: Light Emitting Diode used for the output.
Resistor: Used to limit the current flowing through the LED.
C++: The programming language used for writing the Arduino sketch (with the Arduino-specific libraries).
